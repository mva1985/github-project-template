# thinBASIC GitHub Project Template 2018

This is the official thinBasic GitHub project template.
Please use this project for your new thinBasic projects at GitHub.

## What does it provide
In order to make things more simple for you, this template provides you with:
* Pre created *README.md* file, which you just read and are encouraged to edit to contain appropriate project description
* *.gitattributes* file, which ensures your source files will have preserved Windows line endings
* *.gitignore* file, which ensures you don't upload *.exe* or *.tbasicx* files by accident
